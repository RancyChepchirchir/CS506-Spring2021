# A collaborative exercise to learn Python and Git

## Objective

Build a city! The city will be printed out to the terminal (use python's `print()` function for this) and will have the following components:

- School
- Library
- Museum
- Fire Station
- Police Station
- Restaurant
- Market
- Park
- Lake
- Roads
- Hospital
- Gym
- Power Plant
- Mall
- Trees

Everyone will be responsible for coding at least one component of the city. Each component is a member of a quarter. The quarters of the city are the following:

- Education
- Leisure
- Outdoors
- Safety
- Infrastructure

Once you have coded your component open a Pull Request against this repository. You may receive additional implementation requests in the review of your PR.

We will then merge the PRs and print our city!

## Running the code

    $ python3 city.py
